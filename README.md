 Mobile App Built with React Native for use with the Monolith CO gas detector.

## How to Run Demo
Make sure you have installed the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

Then, navigate to the client folder and run:
```
yarn expo start
```

Scan the QR code with your phone -> this will open up the Expo Go app.

if the QR code is scanning, but not loading, running this instead will fix it:
```
yarn expo start --tunnel
```
